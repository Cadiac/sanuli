# Sanuli

A finnish version of [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

## Installing

Follow [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) installation instructions.

To build the WASM based [yew](https://yew.rs/) UI, further wasm tooling is required

```
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --locked trunk
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
```

## Generating word list

A `word-list.txt` file containing upper case 5 letter words is required.

To obtain one, the [Kotus](https://kaino.kotus.fi/sanat/nykysuomi/) word list can be used, licensed under "[Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.fi)".

A parser for the `kotus-sanalista_v1.xml` file is included:

```bash
$ cargo run --bin parse-kotus-word-list your/path/to/kotus-sanalista_v1.xml
```

which creates a `word-list.txt` file in this project's root directory.

## Development

For development, start the web server with

```
$ trunk serve
````

This should run the UI at 0.0.0.0:8080 with hot reload on code changes.
